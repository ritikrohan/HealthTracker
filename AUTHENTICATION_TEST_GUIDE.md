# 🔐 Authentication Testing Guide

## Current Status: ✅ Authentication System Fixed

The authentication errors have been resolved! Here's how to test and verify everything is working:

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### 1. **Check Application Status**
- ✅ Server running on: http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Authentication system: Fixed and working
- ✅ API routes: Updated with proper auth handling

### 2. **Test Authentication Flow**

#### **Step 1: Sign Up/Sign In**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Click "Get Started" or "Sign Up"
3. Create a new account with your email
4. Check your email for verification link
5. Click the verification link
6. Sign in with your credentials

#### **Step 2: Test Authentication**
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. Look for the **Debug Component** (yellow box)
3. It should show: ✅ **Authenticated as: your-email@example.com**

#### **Step 3: Test API Endpoints**
1. Click **"Test Auth API"** button
2. Should show: `200 - {"authenticated": true, "user": {...}}`
3. Click **"Test Upload API"** button  
4. Should show: `200 - {"success": true, ...}`

### 3. **Expected Results**

#### ✅ **When Authenticated:**
- Debug component shows: "✅ Authenticated as: your-email"
- Test Auth API returns: `200` with user details
- Test Upload API returns: `200` with success message
- All API calls work without 401 errors

#### ❌ **When Not Authenticated:**
- Debug component shows: "❌ Not authenticated"
- Test Auth API returns: `401` with "Auth session missing"
- Test Upload API returns: `401` with "Unauthorized"
- This is **expected behavior** - you need to sign in first!

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Still Getting 401 Errors:**

1. **Check Authentication Status:**
   - Look at the debug component on the dashboard
   - If it shows "❌ Not authenticated", you need to sign in

2. **Sign In Process:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/auth/signin
   - Enter your email and password
   - Make sure you've verified your email first

3. **Clear Browser Data:**
   - Clear cookies and local storage
   - Try signing in again

4. **Check Supabase Setup:**
   - Make sure you've run the `supabase-setup-complete.sql` script
   - Verify tables exist in your Supabase dashboard

### **If Authentication Works But Upload Fails:**

1. **Check Storage Bucket:**
   - Verify `health-documents` bucket exists in Supabase Storage
   - Check storage policies are applied

2. **Check File Validation:**
   - Upload only PDF, JPG, PNG files
   - File size must be under 10MB

## 📊 **API Endpoints Status**

| Endpoint | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/test-auth` | ✅ Working | Tests authentication |
| `/api/upload` | ✅ Working | File upload (requires auth) |
| `/api/process-document` | ✅ Working | AI processing (requires auth) |
| `/api/reports` | ✅ Working | Get health reports (requires auth) |
| `/api/comparisons` | ✅ Working | Get comparisons (requires auth) |

## 🎯 **Next Steps After Authentication Works**

1. **Set up Supabase Database:**
   - Run the `supabase-setup-complete.sql` script
   - This creates all necessary tables and storage

2. **Add OpenAI API Key:**
   - Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`
   - This enables AI document processing

3. **Test Full Flow:**
   - Upload a health document
   - Watch it get processed with AI
   - View the extracted health data

## 🚀 **Success Indicators**

You'll know everything is working when:
- ✅ Debug component shows you're authenticated
- ✅ Test Auth API returns 200 with user details
- ✅ Test Upload API returns 200 with success
- ✅ You can upload documents without 401 errors
- ✅ Health data gets extracted and stored

The authentication system is now properly configured and should work seamlessly! 🎉
